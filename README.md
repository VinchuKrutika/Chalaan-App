# About App :
“CHALAAN” application is designed to reduce the work of traffic police officers as well as for the vehicle owners. In densely populated country like India patience runs thin and forces the people to break the law. This application is designed to keep a track of rules broken by a user as well as making it easier and safer for police to make a chalaan bill.

Our project is based on RTO application, RTO is a Regional Transport Office or Regional Transport Authority (RTO / RTA) is the organization of the Indian government responsible for maintaining a database of drivers and a database of vehicles for various states of India. The RTO issues driving license, organizes collection of vehicle road tax and road fund license and sells personalized registrations. As we know that most of the people driving on road break the rule while the signal is red, so main motive of our application is to capture the photo of that vehicle send to that appropriate driver with fine of breaking the rules.
